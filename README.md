> A social media platform is a place where users can share the happenings in their lives with others. The user must login to view or create the post. A user will be able to login only if he or she registers on the SM app. The user will be able to share about themselves in the format of a post, and a post will include an image and some text (a caption). All the users will be able to share any number of posts. The user can like other users posts. A user can follow other users to view their posts. A user can like another user's post and comment on it. The user should be able to message another user and reply.
